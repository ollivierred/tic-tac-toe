# About this Project

Build a functional, two-person Tic Tac Toe game. Using the provided mockups, HTML, CSS and image files to create a game that requires:
* Players to add their names
* Take turns adding an X or O to the game board
* Announce when the game ends. 

The game will keep track of the state of the game -- whose turn it is, where the X's and O's are on the board, and whether the game is a draw or, if not, who won and lost.

This project uses JavaScript data structures like arrays and objects as well as DOM-manipulation using jQuery or plain JavaScript to complete this project.

And, to ensure good programming practices, this project uses **the module pattern** to create your Tic-Tac-Toe game. In other words, all of this code is wrapped in a single global variable, or executed in a single self-invoking function.
